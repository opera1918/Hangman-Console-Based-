### Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

### Customizing Questions
The game uses a JSON file (data.json) to store the questions and associated words. You can customize the questions and words by modifying this file. Each question and word pair should be in the following format:
```
{
  "question_id": ["word_to_guess", "question"]
}
```
- question_id: A unique identifier for the question.
+ word_to_guess: The word that needs to be guessed.
- question: A clue or question related to the word.
+ You can add or remove question entries as desired.
